Part C: Reflection
In this section, youâ€™ll reflect on your implementation and compare UDP and TCP based on your experience.

Answer the following questions in a short (one to two pages) summary or annotated notebook in Word or PDF format:

How do UDP and TCP differ in socket creation and setup?

How do they handle message exchange and delivery?

What debugging or testing challenges did you encounter?

Based on your experience, what are the trade-offs between using TCP and UDP?

What basic security risks are present in your implementation? How might you begin to address them in Phase 2?

Include the following items with your submission:

At least one screenshot from Wireshark (UDP) and one from Wireshark (TCP).

Clear references to your own code or console output
